        "Our project attempts to predict the reviewers average score. We used \"515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe\" from Kaggle. This dataset contains 515,000 reviews from 1493 different hotels. It includes the study separated by the positive and negative portions, the number of the word count of the positive and negative portions, respectively, locations of the hotel, and days since the review. We could use various techniques (Decision Tree, SVM, Perceptron) to predict the average score and analyze the different approaches to machine learning. In conclusion, we gathered meaningful outcomes from the analysis and evaluation metrics.\n"

        "\n",
        "Beyond location, price, and amenities, consumers judge their perception on a possible hotel to stay out based on the experience “or reviews” of previous guests. For example, according to TripAdvisor, a site for hotel and restaurant reviews and booking, roughly 81% of people always or frequently check a hotel’s reviews before booking [[1]]. However, not all reviews and experiences are weighted equally. According to Sparks, B.A, and Browning, noticed that how information is framed within the review as well as the the focus of the review itself makes the biggest difference in how much a review would affect the overall view of a hotel [[2]]. This begs the question on whether a computer can take a look at these reviews and determine the trust(in the form of ratings) that a hotel has in a similar way to how humans prioritze certain ideas, information, and looking at the overall sentiments.. Sentiment analysis, the ability of extracting emotion, feeling, and other subjective states, has been used on a wide arrangement of different reviews from movies on Netflix to restaurant reviews [[3]]. However, most work on reviews ends with extracting the overall positivity or negativity of the review, not seeing if we can predict or gain insight on the overall view or rating of the hotel, movie, or other thing being reviewed."

        "Our proposed solution to predicting an individual’s score of a hotel will have multiple parts: Preprocessing, data cleaning, determining the best classifier for predicting scores, and finally, training, testing, and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "To preprocess and clean our data we have to remove any entries with missing values as well as remove those that correspond to reviewers who did not write out reviews and instead only gave numerical scores. Since we plan on using sentiment analysis to classify the written reviews, we need to remove the entries that did not provide any additional information aside from a score. We then need to remove any columns that correspond to features we do not need. Thus, the variables we plan on using are: the review date, the average hotel score, hotel name, reviewer nationality, negative review, positive review, the number of reviews the reviewer has given in the past, total number of valid reviews that the hotel has, tags the reviewer has given the hotel.\n",
        "\n",
        "To see if we are able to use machine learning to predict hotel reviews, we will test multiple different models. These models include a linear regression model, a logistic regression model, an SVM, and a decision tree. We will generate predictions with all these models and compare using multiple metrics including mean squared error and accuracy. \n",
        "\n",
        "To split our data into train and test sets, we will use 80% for training and 20% for testing, choosing what entry goes into which set randomly. Once we train our model we will test it, run our evaluation metrics, and plot our results using Matplotlib.\n"

        "We visualized the performance of our linear regression model using an actual versus predicted graph. Ideally, all the points would be closer to the regressed red diagonal line. However, it is evident that the points in our graph are quite dispersed\tand lie far away from the line. This is likely due to the high variance of our data. Though the graph shows that this is probably not the best model for our data, the mean squared error of 1.823 is better than the SVM we tried. Thus, although this simple model proved to perform quite decently, we decided to try and perform further tuning and model selection to achieve better predictions. \n",
        "\n",
        "__Logistic Regression Analysis:__\n",
        "\n",
        " The goal with creating and running a grid search on a logistic regression model is to fit a model which can identify the reviewer score class based on a combination of factors in the hotel data. To determine the “best” model we used the fi-micro score for both l1 and l2 regularization penalties. Our pipeline used a standard scaler and a logistic regression model to predict the reviewer score category. We used a grid search over the optimizers to find the best model and visualized the predictions via a confusion matrix for both l1 and l2 penalties. We also printed out the classification reports to see the precision, recall, and f1 scores for all categories. \n",
        "\n",
        "We found that regardless of using an L1 or L2 regularization penalty, the precision, recall and f1 scores for each category were comparatively similar, and the accuracy and weighted average for both penalties were the same. Accuracy was low, which can be attributed to either the fact that the data is extremely unbalanced when it comes to reviewer scores or that the combination of factors we chose to train our model on were not good or pertinent when predicting the reviewer score. We determined that with these results a logistic regression model would not be a good model to use when classifying reviewer scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using a multi-class precision function with a one-vs-rest strategy, we attempted to determine the overall precision of our best model using the l2 penalty grid search and found that the precision was around 67%. The mean squared error for this model was 3.798, which is remarkably low considering our accuracy was 0.382. Since the accuracy is still so low for our model, we decided to go in a different direction.\n",

        "\n",
        "__Support Vector Machine Analysis:__\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of creating a SVM is to create a decision boundary with margins that should separate the data between classes. To do this we must use a one vs rest approach, which compares one rating score in comparison to the rest of the scores. We created the X data using information from the hotel average score, country, number of positive, number of negative, days since review, views, and number of people. The y data is the integer scores of the reviewer scores.  There are many types of kernels that can be implemented in SVM, so for our project we assessed four of them: linear, radial basis function, sigmoid, and polynomial. For each kernel, we used a function to do a semi-gridsearch to get the optimal C values with the highest accuracy given to us using model.score. After assessing the best C values for each kernel type, we made a classification report and calculated the mean squared error, which we then used to compare performances between all of the kernels. \n",
        "\n",
        "Our analysis showed that the best model was the 9th degree polynomial SVM model. However, given the general accuracy scores of each model, it can be concluded that SVM are not a great model for predicting the reviewer’s rating of a hotel. This could be because SVM is most useful for only binary classification, and even though we used a one vs. rest approach, our problem required the use of 10 classification labels that are very close to each other and harder to distinguish compared to simple binary datasets. Due to this, the SVM would not be the best model to handle our problem statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Decision Tree Analysis:__\n",
        "\n",
        "We approach the problem in two ways, and the first is using a decision tree for regression. We do a multiple regression on the independent variables: total negative words on reviews, total number of reviews, total positive words on reviews, and reviewer score, to estimate the hotel's average score. We employ GridSearch on the hyperparameters: criterion, tree depth, and splitter to find the best model. With this approach, we get an accuracy of 82.10%. \n",
        "\n",
        "The other way we approach the task is with a binary tree classifier. Our input variables are the hotel country and the reviewer's nationality, and we want to classify the average score. We use GridSearch on the hyperparameters criterion and splitter. We get an accuracy of 66.24%. \n",
        "\n",
        "__Multi label Percepetron:__\n",
        "Multiple MLP's were tested with different activation functions (sigmoid vs relu), differing number of layers,differing number of nodes in each layer, and differing batch size resulting in choosing a MLP with three hidden layers layers (with 12,10,10) nodes respectively. \n",
        "\n",
        "With the MLP, we saw fairly solid results with a MSE of various tests ranging from 1.3-1.6. In general, the MLP was a solid model that can be used to predict (with some success) the reviewers score. Beyond what we can see with the accuracy and loss functions, it is important to note that the predictions as a whole tended to be skewed higher than the true scores. This may be due to the natural imbalance in the data, with a more significant portion of the data being above a rating of 5 then below it. In addition, MLP works better with data with a similar sized, data.The scaling may have reducded some of the dimensionality and possibly prevent the MLP from gettingg even more accurate\n",

        "\n",
        "### Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the limitations of our data is that the data itself skewed torwards higher reviews and many of  model predictions reflected that. Even the worst experience on many review sites from Yelp to Trip Advisor often times have a majority of their bad reviews as a 2-3 out of 5 Stars. A full score is much more common than a 1 score. Another limitation is that many of the categories do not have a similar degree (some are or need to one hot encoded while others are in the 100's). This either skews our data heavily to favor certain data over others, or it limits the range of the data (which may have other unintended effects. In addition, some data such as Reviewer Nationality could not be used effectively due to the fact that there are too many categories. It being to spread out lead to not being able to fully utilize the data.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
        "\n",
        "Before beginning this project, our team has acknowledged potential ethics and privacy concerns that may arise from our data and implementation. Primarily, it is important to note that the dataset we plan on using is legally obtained as it is data from Booking.com that has been made publicly available. We discovered this specific collection of data from Kaggle.com, posted by Jiashen Liu who curated the dataset and made it available to the public domain to copy and modify as we intend to do. It is also important to acknowledge the potential biases in the dataset. Most notably, each data entry includes the nationality of the user which is one of the many various features provided by the dataset that we can use to predict the user’s score of the hotel. We take this into consideration as it can result in a potential bias in our predictions. Our team has also taken into consideration the privacy of the responders and has assured that the privacy of all reviewers is upheld as there are no identifying personal features other than the reviewer’s nationality. However, though there may be personal information in specific written reviews, all information was freely given by the individual. Thus, the anonymity of individuals is maintained. One way we can address these ethical and privacy concerns is through using an ethics checklist that addresses important ethical considerations in data collection, modeling, and analysis. A useful tool we can use to add such a checklist to our project is the command line tool, Deon.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, we have proven that it is possible with some degree of success to be able to predict a person’s review score of a hotel based on data on the review itself. This is important because it can be applied by companies, apart from just hotels, to improve customer experience and drive advertising. Possible further research includes utilizing the same review data to predict the overall rating of a hotel, not just an individual’s rating of the hotel. "
